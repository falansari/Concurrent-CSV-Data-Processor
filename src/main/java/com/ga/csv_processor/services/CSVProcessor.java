    - Locks: The java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock interface provides a more flexible synchronization mechanism than intrinsic locks.
    It allows for more advanced locking strategies such as reentrant locks, fair locks, and condition variables.

    - Atomic operations: Java provides atomic classes such as AtomicInteger, AtomicLong, and AtomicReference in the java.util.concurrent.atomic package.
    These classes provide atomic operations that are guaranteed to be executed without interruption,
    making them useful for implementing thread-safe operations on primitive types and object references.
